        Why did I make this streaming website? Well, it all started when I sat
        down to watch a show on Netflixâ€”until Netflix hit me with a subscription
        price that made my wallet cry. I figured, instead of paying for yet
        another streaming service, why not build my own?

        I wanted to learn how APIs work, dive into JavaScript, and create
        something cool from scratch. Plus, sticking it to overpriced
        subscriptions felt like a nice bonus. So, after wrestling with code,
        learning the magic of APIs, and maybe losing a bit of sleep, here we
        are!
